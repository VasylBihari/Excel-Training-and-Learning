📌 Description
In this project, I demonstrate the complete workflow of an analyst, from data cleaning to creating an interactive dashboard in Excel. 
This is a typical task that you might encounter in a Junior/Middle Data Analyst position.

 I took the raw data from the Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/urvishahir/global-freelancers-raw-dataset [dataset](https://github.com/VasylBihari/Excel-Training-and-Learning/blob/main/Global-Freeelancers-Project/global_freelancers_raw.csv)

 What has been implemented:
