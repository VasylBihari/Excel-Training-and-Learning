## 🧠 Project: Global Freelancers
Technologies: Excel (Power Query, Pivot Tables, Slicers)

📌 Description
In this project, I demonstrate the complete workflow of an analyst, from data cleaning to creating an interactive dashboard in Excel. 
This is a typical task that you might encounter in a Junior/Middle Data Analyst position.

 I took the raw data from the Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/urvishahir/global-freelancers-raw-dataset 

 This dataset contains 1,000 fictional freelancer profiles from around the world, 
 designed to reflect realistic variability and messiness often encountered in real-world data collection.

 What has been implemented:

🔍 Data cleaning and preparation (Power Query)

📊 Creating pivot tables

🎛️ Adding interactivity with filters and slices
