## Data cleaning in Microsoft Excel

This mini-project demonstrates the process of cleaning a small set of data in Microsoft Excel: 

-removing duplicates;
-filling in missing values;
-matching data formats (numeric, date, text).

The goal is to show how basic Excel tools can significantly improve data quality.
